# BREAST-CANCER-PREDICTION-USING-DECISION-TREE
Cancer prediction on Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using supervised Decision Tree. The model have achieved 95% of accuracy

This project implements Decision Tree to classify breast cancer as malignant[0] or benign[1] using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%. Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report shows high prediction accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of Decision Tree for medical diagnosis tasks.
